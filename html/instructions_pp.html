    <h1>Instructions of the Ultimatum Game. Please read them carefully</h1>
    <div id="instructions">
      This game is played in rounds by two human players randomly paired.
      <br><br>
      In each round, one of the them, called <em>BIDDER</em>, makes an offer to the other player,
      called <em>RESPONDENT</em>, about how to share 100 ECU (Experimental Currency). 100 ECU are equal to 0.10 USD.
      <br><br>
      The RESPONDENT can either accept or reject the offer of the BIDDER.
      If he / she accepts, both players split 100 ECU accordingly, else both get 0.
      <br><br>
      The game is repeated 20 rounds.
      <br><br>
      <p id="pp" class="important">
        Important. If one of the players disconnects for more than 30 seconds the game will be terminated.<br/>
        In such a case the player who disconnected will not be paid at all, and the remaining ones will be paid only the show up fee.
